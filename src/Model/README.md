Do **NOT** make any manual changes inside this folder.

All files in this folder are generated automatically with `PLUGIN/tools/bake.sh`. You should be able to delete the contents of this folder if necessary and re-generate everything with `bake.sh` at any point.

If you need to change existing files or add new files, do that in [`PLUGIN/tools`](../../tools). Then run `bake.sh` - see [`PLUGIN/tools`](../../tools) for more info. It is also safe to overwrite the contents of this folder, so you should be able to run `bake.sh` repeatedly.
